🌍 Mapping Global Power Through UN Voting

An Interactive Analysis of United Nations General Assembly Voting (1946–2024)

📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes UN General Assembly voting behavior over time to understand global power dynamics, ideological polarization, and alignment among major world powers. Rather than relying on static figures, the analysis is presented primarily through interactive HTML visualizations, enabling clearer interpretation and more effective presentation.

The project culminates in a web-based narrative dashboard, with `index.html` serving as the main entry point.

❓ Research Questions
Main Question

How have global voting alignments and ideological divisions in the UN evolved from 1946 to the present?

Sub-Questions

How polarized has UN voting been across different historical periods?

How closely do major powers align with the United States over time?

How do major powers align with one another across decades?

How has global voting cohesion changed in the post–Cold War era?

📊 Data Source

United Nations General Assembly Voting Data (1946–2024)
The dataset includes country-level voting behavior (Yes / No / Abstain) and enables long-run analysis of ideological alignment and polarization.

🔬 Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing in Python

Construction of voting alignment and polarization measures

Generation of interactive visualizations using Plotly and Bokeh

Export of plots as standalone HTML files

Integration of all visuals into a single narrative webpage (index.html)

📈 Key Insights

UN voting behavior shows clear historical phases (Cold War, post-Cold War, multipolar era).

Major power alignments are dynamic rather than fixed.

Interactive visualizations reveal patterns not evident in raw data or static plots.

Web-based presentation improves interpretability and storytelling.
